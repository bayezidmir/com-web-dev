        <h3>I Am a Future Software Engineer</h3>
        <p class="why">
          I am in sales for last 3 years and I felt, I was into it. However,
          recenty I have a feeling of apathy toward sales because of not geeting
          any recognition of my contribution from my current organization.
          besides, the insecurity and the perspective with which people consider
          a sales advisor. In addition, I have been longing for a long time be
          in the IT industry, and I have recently figured my overwhelming
          interest in learing web development.

        <h1>Dream Big</h1>
        <h3>Becoming a Web Developer</h3>
        <p class="why">
          You might be wondering why am I calling myself a software engineer.
          Well, being a full-time service holder, I have been working so hard on
          learing web development. As of today, I have managed to learn HTML,
          CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. In addition, I have enrolled for the
          the complete web development course being offered by Jhankar Mahbub.
          Therefore, I bet, I can become an efficient and competent software
          Engineer, In Sha Allah.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working with friendly
            people.
