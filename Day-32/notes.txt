Variable:

const- when we do not need to reasign value to a variable in another line
let- when we need to reassign value to a variable in another line

Template String:
``- this is called bactick, which we can use for template string. Within a template string we can insert variable followig this ${}
ex: `this is Bayezid Mir who is a citizen of ${variable-name}.`


Default Parameter:
setting a default value of a function's parameter when no value is provided of particular variable
ex: function longestName(name='bayezid'){
  //up there bayezid is the default value. if anyone calls or invoke function without providing parameter value he will get Bayezid as longest name

}

Spread operator:
using three dot before an array convert that to something without third braces
ex: const numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
taking "numbers" value to another array. const anotherNumbers=[...numbers,25,35,40]; 25, 35 & 40 is the number I have added extra to the new variable

Arrow Function: 
const ajobJinish=(a,b)=>a+b //arrow function with implicit return
const ajobBoro=(a,b)=>{
  connst sum= a+b;
  const diff=a-b;
  const multiplicationOf=sum*diff;
  return multiplicationOf; // arrow function with explicit return
}


filter- provides all when meets condition, if not found any provide undefined
find- gives only the very first result
