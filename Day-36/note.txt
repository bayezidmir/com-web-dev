object literal, ex: const student={name:'bayezid', id:0589}

object contructor
const employee= new Object()

const human=Object.create(null)
const human=Object.create(student)
console.log(human.id)

class People{
  name;
  age;
  constructor(name,age){
 this.name=name
 this.age=age
  }
}

syntectical sugar - declaring object from the value of class

const bottle={
  color: "green", storage:"2 litre"
}

there  color: "green" together is called key value pair, color is the key and green is the value
using Object.entries we get the return of two dimensional arrays
sealing an object allow modification of object value but does not allow delete or add element. but freeze does not even allow modification
