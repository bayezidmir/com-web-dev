DOM:
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

Object: Bunch of charecter
Model: A copy or prototype or a replica of original one


document.getElementsByTagName- is a tag name thus require parameter. if tag is string then keep them within an inverted commma;
ex: document.getElementsByTagName('h3')

we can find an tag (element) from html by using "getElementsByTagName", "getElementById" "getElementsByClassName","getElementByClassName" ,"querySelector", "querySelectorAll" and can chage the style and text using .style and .innerText. ex: document.getElementById('id).style.color="red" ,  document.getElementById('id).innerText="hello world" 

using querySelector for multiple item with same class or tag will provide you only the first item. to get get all the element with same same tag or class use querySelectorAll


when we use querySelector we have to use '.' for class '#' for ID 

getAttribute("attribute name")- used to get the element within a tag
setAttribute("attribute name")- used to set new element within a tag
parentNode("attribute name")- used to get the parent tag of that tag
childNodes("attribute name")- used to get the child within a tag
